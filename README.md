## Description

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all. This README generator creates an outline with a couple good practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README. At the minimum, your generated README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
