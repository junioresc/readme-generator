## Description

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile—and one that many new developers often overlook—is the README.md file. There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README. At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

## Contributing


Before submitting the pull request, you first need to describe the changes you made (rather than asking the project maintainers to figure them out on their own). You should write a descriptive title for your pull request, and then include more details in the body of the pull request. If there are any related GitHub issues, make sure to mention those by number. The body can include Markdown formatting, and you can click the Preview tab to see how it will look.
    

## Tests

    Below the pull request form, you will see a list of the commits you made in your branch, as well as the "diffs" for all of the files you changed.
